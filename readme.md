# stage-presentation-mai

Small angular slider that I built for a school presentation. You can see the result [here](stage-presentation-mai.herokuapp.com).

## Installation

Install node module
```
npm install
```

## Usage

You can easily clone the project to your computer and add your own slide. All you have to do is modify the html to add you slide, the `$scope.model.slides` variable (which is used to generate the navigation) and the ` $scope.model.max` variable to your maximum number of slides.

###Grunt tasks
Development task ['less:development', 'concat', 'watch']
```
grunt dev
```

## History

I will probably make this more dynamic by using MongoDB and creating an admin side to create multiple presentation and slides 



## Contribute

If you wanna take part in building the application full application with node, angular and mongo. Just let me know we'll talk about it and see if what I have in mind fits what you have in mind.
